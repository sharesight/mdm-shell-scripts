# Zoom Installation Script

This script is an example to show how to use [Intune Shell Scripting](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/apps/macos-shell-scripts) to install applications. In this case the script will download the Zoom.pkg file from the Zoom download servers and then install it onto the Mac.


## Script Settings

- Run script as signed-in user : No
- Hide script notifications on devices : Not configured
- Script frequency : Weekly
- Mac number of times to retry if script fails : 3

## Log File

The log file will output to ***/Library/Logs/Jamf/Scripts/installZoom/Zoom.log*** by default. Exit status is either 0 or 1. To gather this log with Intune remotely take a look at  [Troubleshoot macOS shell script policies using log collection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/apps/macos-shell-scripts#troubleshoot-macos-shell-script-policies-using-log-collection)
