# Microsoft Remote Desktop Installation Script

This script is an example to show how to use [Intune Shell Scripting](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/apps/macos-shell-scripts) to install applications. In this case the script will download the Microsoft Remote Desktop app from the Microsoft download servers and then install it onto the Mac.

## Scenario

This scripts intended usage scenario is for customers who wish to use a shell script to deploy the Microsoft Remote Desktop app.

## Quick Run

```
sudo /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/shell-intune-samples/master/Apps/Remote%20Desktop/installRemoteDesktop.sh)"
```

## Script Settings

- Run script as signed-in user : No
- Hide script notifications on devices : Not configured
- Script frequency : Not configured
- Number of times to retry if script fails : 3

## Log File

The log file will output to ***/Library/Logs/Jamf/Scripts/installRemoteDesktop/Remote Desktop.log*** by default. Exit status is either 0 or 1. To gather this log with Intune remotely take a look at  [Troubleshoot macOS shell script policies using log collection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/apps/macos-shell-scripts#troubleshoot-macos-shell-script-policies-using-log-collection)
