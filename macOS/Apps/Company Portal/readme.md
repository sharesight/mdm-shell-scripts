# Intune Company Portal Installation Script

This script is an example to show how to use [Intune Shell Scripting](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/apps/macos-shell-scripts) to install applications. In this case the script will download the Company Portal pkg file from the Microsoft download servers and then install it onto the Mac.

## Scenario

This script has a few scenarios

- DEP/ADE enrolled Macs that need to complete their device registration for conditional access. In this scenario the script should be deployed [via Intune]((https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/apps/macos-shell-scripts)).

- Provide end users with a quick and easy way to get started with their Mac enrollment. In this scenario the end users should be provided with the following to copy and paste into Terminal on their Mac.


## Quick Run

```
sudo /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/shell-intune-samples/master/Apps/Company%20Portal/installCompanyPortal.sh)" ; open "/Applications/Company Portal.app"
```

## Script Settings

- Run script as signed-in user : No
- Hide script notifications on devices : Not configured
- Script frequency : Not configured
- Number of times to retry if script fails : 3

## Log File

The log file will output to ***/Library/Logs/Jamf/Scripts/installCompanyPortal/Company Portal.log*** by default. Exit status is either 0 or 1. To gather this log with Intune remotely take a look at  [Troubleshoot macOS shell script policies using log collection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/apps/macos-shell-scripts#troubleshoot-macos-shell-script-policies-using-log-collection)
