# gitHub Desktop for Mac Installation Script

This script is an example showing how to use [Intune Shell Scripting](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/apps/macos-shell-scripts) to install an application. In this instance the script downloads the gitHub Desktop files, uncompresses them and installs into the /Applications directory.

## Scenario

This scripts intended usage scenario is to deploy the gitHub Desktop app to Mac devices that need to use it.


## Script Settings

- Run script as signed-in user : No
- Hide script notifications on devices : Not configured
- Script frequency : Not configured
- Number of times to retry if script fails : 3

## Log File

The log file will output to **/Library/Logs/Jamf/Scripts/installGitHubDesktop/GitHub Desktop.log** by default. Exit status is either 0 or 1. To gather this log with Intune remotely take a look at [Troubleshoot macOS shell script policies using log collection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/apps/macos-shell-scripts#troubleshoot-macos-shell-script-policies-using-log-collection).
