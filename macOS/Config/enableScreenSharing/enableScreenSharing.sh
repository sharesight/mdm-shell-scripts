# Note: If you don't do this, the remote client will just see a black screen with the vnc client or screen sharing app won't connect.
# however, by resetting the Screen Capture permissions, anything that has previously been granted the permission will need to be re-added
# this includes things like Teams, Zoom, Snagit etc.
#
# On an ADE enrolled Mac this probably isn't a problem, but for a user initiated enrollment it probably is something you'll want to think about
# before deploying widely.
